/**
 * Build the bibliography of a document when its page opens.
 *
 * This class is the one that knows in which order the work is done, and it is
 * the only one that does: reading the data, then preparing the references,
 * then composing the bibliography. It is also the only place where an error is
 * caught. Whatever happens, run() never raises: a page that opens a
 * bibliography has nothing to protect itself from, and a document whose data
 * are missing is still a document.
 *
 * Nobody runs anything: the author writes BibTeX entries and text, and the
 * work happens in the browser of whoever opens the page.
