## Automatic CuedSpeech: Overview

The problem of cueing speech is divided into 4 sequential tasks:

    1. WHAT? From the time-aligned phonemes, what are the keys?
    2. WHEN? From the time-aligned keys, when moving the hand (position and shape)?
    3. WHERE? Where should the hand be located, looking at the face?
    4. HOW? How the hand should look like?


> The "what", "when" and "where" questions does not require any specific feature.
> The "how" packages require "video" feature of SPPAS to be enabled.
